<p>My first year here was stressful not knowing what and where, plus it didn't help that I felt I couldn't fit in. I decided to wear my favourite suit one day and after that day I have had so much confidence I just keep bragging about how good I am behind a computer screen. This workplace shown me I wasn't alone or left out I just didn't understand gaming properly until now.</p>

<blockquote>- Jessica's first time research with us...</blockquote>

<p>When I first seen this site, I checked it out because I wanted  to learn gaming recently as all my friends play it, yet I'm stuck on my own gameless and clueless. So here I was and I come across this site of recommendations and popularity in games too. I have found more than one game I am to play and compete with my friends online now!</p>

<blockquote>- Eithan's first and only time using our website...</blockquote>
